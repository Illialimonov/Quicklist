# Quicklist

## Project Overview
**Quicklist** is a user-driven marketplace application where users can list items for sale, communicate with listing owners, and save their favorite items. 

## Key Features
- **Item Listing**: Users can easily list items for sale and manage their listings.
- **Messaging System**: We implemented a simplified messaging system where users can send an email to the owner whose listing they liked.
- **Favorites**: Users can save their favorite listings for later reference.

# Technologies I used: 

## Cloud Services and Infrastructure
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: The project makes extensive use of AWS services for scalability and storage.
  - **S3**: Used for storing user profile pictures and images of listed items.
  - **RDS (Relational Database Service)**: PostgreSQL database to manage user and item data.
  - **EC2**: Deployed the web application on EC2 for continuous availability (24/7).
  - **Certificate Manager**: Managed SSL certificates for secure HTTPS connections.

## Authentication and Security
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Used for user authentication, ensuring secure and stateless sessions.
- **Spring Security**: Implemented to handle user authorization and access control across the application.

## Frontend Collaboration
- **Website Layout**: Designed the core structure and layout of the website, ensuring it is user-friendly and visually appealing.
- **Frontend Adjustments**: Worked closely with the frontend developer to refine the UI/UX based on their feedback, ensuring smooth integration with the backend.
